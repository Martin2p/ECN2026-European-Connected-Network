# ECN2026 – European Connected Network

## Overview
ECN2026 is a personal network engineering project simulating a multi-site
European network across Sweden, Switzerland and Germany.

The goal is to design, implement and document a realistic campus and backbone
architecture using limited hardware and enterprise-grade concepts.

## Sites
- Sweden (Access Site)
- Switzerland (Core / Campus Site)
- Germany (Cloud / VPS Backbone)

## Key Topics
- Routing & subnetting
- VLAN-based segmentation
- Site-to-site VPN (WireGuard)
- Firewalling & basic hardening
- Monitoring & logging concepts
