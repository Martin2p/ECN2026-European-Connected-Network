## Physical Layer Scope

The physical layer covers all passive and active components responsible for signal transmission:

- Ethernet cabling (copper)
- Connectors and terminations
- Network interfaces (NICs)
- Switch ports and transceivers
- Physical link characteristics (speed, duplex, error counters)

Wireless technologies are out of scope for this document.

## Cabling Standards & Design Decisions

- Twisted-pair copper Ethernet is used throughout the project
- Focus on Cat5e / Cat6-class cabling for realism and availability
- Self-crimped cables are intentionally used to validate installation quality
- Flat Ethernet cables are evaluated but treated as non-preferred for high-speed links

## Error Metrics & Monitoring

Physical layer quality is evaluated using the following indicators:

- CRC / FCS error counters
- RX / TX error statistics
- Link flaps and renegotiations
- Throughput stability under load
- Duplex and speed consistency

Monitoring is performed on both switch and host level.

## Known Limitations

- No certified cable measurement (NEXT, FEXT, insertion loss)
- No professional cable certifier used
- Results represent practical validation, not formal certification

## Relation to OSI Model

Although primarily focused on OSI Layer 1, physical layer issues are evaluated in conjunction with:

- Layer 2 (Ethernet framing, CRC errors)
- Link negotiation behavior (auto-negotiation)

This reflects real-world troubleshooting, where Layer 1 and Layer 2 are tightly coupled.

## Validation & Testing

Practical cable validation tests are documented separately:
